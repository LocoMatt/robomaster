- Make all module startup fully asynchronous.
    - Each module will keep track of its connected/disconnected startus.
    - Modules that depend on other modules should listen to those status changes and act accordingly.
    - Probabloy never set a module to nil and, instead, use Connected() to gat all calls (unless it becomes expensive).
- Finish up Chassis example tests.
- Implement example tests for all other modules (will require updates to key value types).
- Move larger examples (robot control, tracker) to their own repos. Modules within modules is not working very well.
- Improve mobile interface.
- Support other Robomaster functionality (TBD).
