# Robomaster Playground

Welcome to the RoboMaster Playground! This directory is dedicated to exploring direct control of the robot without using the unitybriodge library. Here, we will leverage packet sniffing and clever hacking techniques to reverse engineer the protocol.

## Getting Started

To get started with direct control of the RoboMaster robot, follow these steps:

1. Set up your development environment by installing the necessary tools and dependencies.
2. Familiarize yourself with packet sniffing techniques and protocols used by the Robomaster platform.
3. Analyze the captured packets to understand the communication protocol between the robot and the control system.
4. Develop custom code to interact with the robot directly, bypassing the unitybriodge library.
5. Test and iterate on your code to ensure reliable and accurate control of the robot.

## Resources

Here are some resources to help you in your journey of reverse engineering and direct control of the RoboMaster robot:

- [Robomaster SDK (Useful for CmdSet/CmdID definitions)](https://github.com/dji-sdk/RoboMaster-SDK/tree/master)
- [Reverse Engineering Basics](https://www.malwaretech.com/2017/01/reverse-engineering-basics.html)

Happy hacking!
