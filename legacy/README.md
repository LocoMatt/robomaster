# legacy

Collection of code, tools and samples for developing programs for the RoboMaster S1.

The code in this directory was reverse engineered form the desktop DJI Robomaster
app and, as such, might break if DJI changes anything about it. This is here most
for legacy purposes and to allow a fallback if using the SDK mode stops working in
the S1 (as it requires a hack to have it enabled).
